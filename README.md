Project Overview

this project uses the classicmodels database to explore customer, order, and employee information. the goal is to analyze data, find patterns, and create insights that help businesses make better decisions. it demonstrates how to filter data, calculate averages, identify top customers and employees, create reusable summaries, and combine information from multiple tables.

1. exploring customers

we started by looking at all the customer information in the database. this gives an overall view of who the customers are, where they are located, and their credit limits. it helps understand the size and distribution of the customer base.

2. filtering customers

next, we focused on specific customers based on criteria such as country and credit limit. for example, we filtered customers from the usa who have high credit limits. this helps identify important or high-value customers for targeted analysis or marketing.

3. comparing average credit limits

we calculated the average credit limit for each country. this allows us to compare countries and understand which regions have customers with higher credit capacity. it can help businesses plan regional strategies or focus on high-potential markets.

4. using subqueries for insights

subqueries are like asking a question inside another question. we used them to find:

customers whose credit limit is higher than the overall average

orders where the total amount exceeds a certain threshold

employees managing a large number of customers

these insights help identify top customers, high-value orders, and active employees, which are critical for business decisions.

5. creating reusable summaries with views

views are like saved reports. instead of repeating complex analysis every time, we created views for:

customers with very high credit limits

total sales per customer

using views makes it easier to quickly get consistent results, saves time, and reduces the chance of mistakes.

6. combining tables with joins

sometimes, important information is spread across multiple tables. we used joins to combine them and answer questions like:

which customer placed which order

all customers and their orders, including customers who havenâ€™t placed any orders

all orders along with the corresponding customer information

this helps get a complete picture of business operations and relationships between customers and orders.
